Swagger2CAT tool
================

POC trying to generate CAT namespace from swagger specification. This is still work in
progress and works only for Kubernetes swagger specification for the moment. Kubernetes
swagger spec implements version 1.2 of swagger.

bundle exec bin/swagger2cat will print the namespace for kubernetes into stdout
